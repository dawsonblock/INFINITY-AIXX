INFINITY AI – WHAT TO TUNE FIRST (CHEAT SHEET)

Training unstable
- Lower PPO learning rate
- Reduce PPO epochs / minibatch ratio
- Add/verify LayerNorm on fused workspace
- Reduce world model hidden size or lr

Overthinking / hesitation
- Lower counterfactual uncertainty penalty
- Shorten counterfactual horizon
- Raise the confidence threshold to enter deliberation

Random / noisy actions
- Increase rollout length (more on-policy signal)
- Lower entropy coef
- Ensure action logits are not saturated (check init/std)

Imagination drift
- Increase w_next loss weight
- Reduce horizon until predictions are accurate
- Verify terminal masking (done) on w_next targets

World model not helping
- Ensure it trains every PPO update
- Delay use of deliberation until WM loss falls
- Inspect u_hat calibration (too high = timid, too low = reckless)
